# Ecosystem FAQ

## **What is the Provenance Ecosystem?**

**jaja**

## **Who is the team developing the Provenance Network?** <a id="who-is-the-team-developing-the-provenance-network"></a>

**The Provenance Network is a project that is supported by the Provenance Foundation. Most of the initial software development was done by the team from Figure Technology Inc. Over time, in the spirit of community building, the development will become more decentralized. Please check out Provenance’s grants program and apply for funding to develop one of the PIPs.**

## **Where is the code?** <a id="where-is-the-code"></a>

**All the Provenance ecosystem code is maintained within Github \(ref?\)**

## **What is the open source license used for the code?** <a id="what-is-the-open-source-license-used-for-the-code"></a>

**The open source license for all the code is the Apache 2.0 license \(ref?\)**

## **How does Provenance fit into Cosmos’ Internet of Blockchains?** <a id="how-does-provenance-fit-into-cosmos-internet-of-blockchains"></a>

**Cosmos’ FAQ reads:**

**Cosmos is the blockchain pioneer of the Hub & Spoke architecture. Hubs act as routers for Zones. “Zones” are Cosmos-speak for “application-specific blockchains”. Each Zone is a spoke connected to a hub. Hubs can be connected with other hubs. Together, this ecosystem of connected Hubs and Zones makes up the Cosmos Network, or what is commonly referred to as the ‘Internet of the Blockchains’. Note that the Cosmos ecosystem is entirely permission-less, meaning that anyone can create a Hub or a Zone, and each blockchain is free to accept or refuse connections with other blockchains.**

**Within this Cosmos Network, the Provenance blockchain network should be considered a “Zone”, i.e. application-specific blockchain. Note: in April 2021, the Inter-Blockchain Protocol \(ICB\), was truly bleeding edge technology, and Provenance was letting others kick the tires first, before truly connecting to the Cosmos Hub as a Zone through IBC.**

## **Where can I get Developer support?** <a id="where-can-i-get-developer-support"></a>

**Check out the Provenance Developer Chat and the Provenance Github repos for technical support from the growing community of Provenance developers.**

## **Where can I find a tutorial of how to build a Provenance app?** <a id="where-can-i-find-a-tutorial-of-how-to-build-a-provenance-app"></a>

**Visit the Provenance Tutorials website to learn how to build your own Provenance app in minutes. \(ref?\)**

## **What is the Provenance SDK?** <a id="what-is-the-provenance-sdk"></a>

**The Provenance SDK is a modular development framework that allows developers to easily build application-specific blockchains, i.e. side-chains \(‘Zones’ in Cosmos terminology\).**

**Read more about the Provenance SDK here \(ref?\).**

## **How secure is this Provenance blockchain network?** <a id="how-secure-is-this-provenance-blockchain-network"></a>

**Although there are no guarantees in security, the Provenance developers put a lot of effort in following best practices in coding and operations. In addition, NCCGroup did a security assessment and audit of the Provenance services, and all its critical findings have been addressed. NCCGroup’s report can be read here \(ref?\). The Cosmos SDK is scheduled to go through a similar review \(ref?\). The Provenance funding program will sponsor ongoing security assessments and code audits on a regular basis to adhere to security best practices. The foundation will also sponsor a bug bounty program to find security vulnerabilities and further improve the code.**
