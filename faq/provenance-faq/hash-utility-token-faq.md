# Hash Utility Token FAQ

## **Does Provenance have a token?**

**Yes, the Provenance blockchain network has the Hash utility-token that is used to pay for its services \(gas\), staking, and investment.**

**Note: Provenance’s Hash tokens are equivalent to but not the same as Cosmos-Hub’s Atoms.**

## **What is the initial allocation of Hash?** <a id="what-is-the-initial-allocation-of-hash"></a>

**The Provenance Foundation received 1.25% of the total Hash allotment at its inception. The remaining percentage was distributed according to the results of the private and public fundraisers.**

## **How many HASH have been minted?** <a id="how-many-hash-have-been-minted"></a>

**The number of Hash utility-tokens that have been minted is 100,000,000,000. This number is fixed and there will never be more than this number of Hash available.**

## **What is the utility of Hash?** <a id="what-is-the-utility-of-hash"></a>

**Hash has three use cases: as a spam-prevention mechanism, as a staking token, and as a voting mechanism in governance.**

**As a spam prevention mechanism, Hash is used to pay fees for the Provenance blockchain services. Similar to Ethereum’s concept of “gas”, the fee may be proportional to the amount of computation required by the transaction. Fee distribution is done in-protocol and a protocol specification is described here. \(ref? - link to Cosmos’ gas/staking explanation\)**

**As staking tokens, Hash may be “bonded” to earn block rewards. The economic security of the Provenance network is a function of the amount of Hash staked. The more Hash that is collateralized, the more “skin” there is at stake and the higher the cost of attacking the network. Thus, the more Hash there are bonded, the greater the economic security of the network.**

**Hash stakers may govern the Provenance Foundation by voting on proposals with their staked Hash.**

## **How do I get HASH?** <a id="how-do-i-get-hash"></a>

**Hash is listed on multiple exchanges where it is publicly traded.**

## **What is the difference between Hash, Hash 2.0 and Hash 1.0, and Provenance, Provenance 2.0 and Provenance 1.0?**

**Hash is short for Hash 2.0, and Provenance is short for Provenance 2.0. When Hash is referred to with a capital “H”, it’s the utility-token used to pay for the Provenance blockchain related services or the gas as it’s commonly called. Hash is equivalent to, but not the same as, the Atom tokens used for the CosmosHub services.  
Provenance’s first generation blockchain service was based on HyperLedger and is referred to as Provenance 1.0. Hash 1.0 was the legacy currency used in that Provenance 1.0 blockchain. The terms Provenance 1.0 and Hash 1.0 will soon have only historical significance and probably will make its original developers a bit teary eyed.**
