# Client Side Contracts

Client side contracts differ from Smart Contracts in that they keep your data private between parties off chain, and allow a structure to record agreed upon state data to the blockchain. Smart contracts in comparison are running on the blockchain and require the validators to have access to the data which isnâ€™t a great solution for most consumer based transactions due to data privacy laws.
