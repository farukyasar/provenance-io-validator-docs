# Encrypted Object Store

Assigned: Steve

Data submitted to Provenance is encrypted using ECIES and the DIME format before being stored in the affiliateâ€™s object storage. The Encrypted Object Store was built using Google Cloud Storage. Other data storage solutions can be used providing the required integrations are built. The affiliate submitting the data grants permission to the data to other affiliates. All permissioned affiliates will also store a copy of the encrypted data \(in the DIME format\) in their object store.
