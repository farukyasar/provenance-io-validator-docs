# Voting

Proposals are initiatives put to vote by stake holders to perform actions using a consensus of votes. This process is called governance. The proposals themselves may be simple statements \(text proposals\) or initiatives to change configuration parameters \(configuration change proposals\), software upgrades, and more.

Voting is the process of assigning active stake to one of the four different states for a proposal \[yes, no, abstain, veto\]. At the end of the voting period the votes are tallied according to the amount of active stake assigned to each category. With the exception of the veto category, the category with the majority of the stake assigned to it is marked as the outcome of the proposal.

Only actively staked hash can be used for a vote. Each actively staked Hash corresponds to one vote. If a delegator does not vote directly, the power of the delegator's active delegations will be assigned to the category the validator node operator chooses for their vote. The participation rate for voting is available as part of the status of a proposal during and after the voting period.
