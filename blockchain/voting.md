# Voting

* What is voting?
  * Voting is the process of assigning your active stake to one of the four different states for a proposal \[yes, no, abstain, veto\]. At the end of the voting period the votes are tallyed according to the amount of active stake assigned to each category.  With the exception of the veto category the category with the majority of the stake assigned to it is marked as the outcome of the proposal
* What are proposals?
  * Proposals are initiatives put to vote by stake holders to perform actions using a consensus of votes.  This process is called governacne.  The proposals themselves my be simple statements \(text proposals\) or initiatives to change configuration parameters \(configuration change proposals\), software upgrades, and more.
* How does my staked Hash related to the vote?
  * Only your actively staked hash can be used for a vote.  If you do not vote directly the power of your active delegations will be assigned to the category the validator node operator chooses for their vote.
* What can I vote on? \(List of past and current proposals \(Provenance explorer\)\)
* What if I donâ€™t vote?
  * Your vote may be assigned based on the vote of the validator you have staked against, or your vote may simply not be tallyed.  The participation rate for voting is available as part of the status of a proposal during and after the voting period.
