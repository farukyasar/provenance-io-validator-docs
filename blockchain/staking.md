Decent explanation of Staking/bonding. Not ours!

So when you want to stake your ATOMs, you need to choose a validator to delegate them to. This is called “bonding”—it means that you’ve dedicated your ATOM to a particular node who votes to produce the next block in the blockchain \(that node is a validator—important to note that all validators are nodes, but not all nodes are validators\).

In exchange for their work in maintaining the network, validators will take a commission of the staking rewards generated with each block \(so far it seems anywhere from 0% up to 20%\). A validator can choose how much they wish to take as a commission when setting up their validator.

If you no longer want to delegate your ATOM to a particular validator \(or any\), and let’s say you want to sell them or send them to an exchange or another address, you need to unbond them. That simply means that you withdraw them from the validator. But as you withdraw them from the validator, they have to be held for a period of 21 days. During this time, they are “frozen” as in you can’t withdrawal them from your current address, or move them anywhere.

When you stake your ATOM, it runs a bit of a risk, because in order to keep validators accountable, the system will punish them if they are disconnected from the network for a certain period of time, or if they try to double spend/sign \(i.e. try to hack the chain\). When this happens, the system takes and burns a percentage of the ATOM delegated to it, up to 5%.

So if you’re delegating to a validator who gets punished, you can take up to a 5% haircut on your staked ATOM—and possibly more. This is a way to keep delegators \(stakers\) active in monitoring their validators and holding them accountable.
