# Mission

**Blockchain has the potential to change the world of finance.** 

The $300+ trillion in global financial markets incur hundreds of billions of dollars in audit, custody, trustee, reconciliation and administrative costs each year. Many of these markets suffer from significant friction, lack of transparency and limited liquidity. Figure Technologies, Inc. \(Figure ® \) has launched a production blockchain, Provenance™, to transform financial services. 

Provenance will dramatically reduce costs, improve liquidity, reduce risk and open new financial markets. Provenance is a proof of stake blockchain based on three key concepts: 

* Distributed - No entity owns Provenance Blockchain, and identical information is held across multiple stakeholders. 
* Immutable - Information is time stamped and cannot be changed. 
* Trustless - Truth replaces trust in information.  

Provenance acts as ledger, registry and exchange across financial assets and markets. 

The initial use case for Provenance is demonstrating how the blockchain can eliminate fees and inefficiencies in the loan origination, servicing and securitization markets. In July of 2018, Figure began generating home equity loans and subsequently selling them to financial buyers on Provenance – an industry first. Loan origination, payments, sales, financing - and in Q3 2019 loan securitization – happen entirely on Provenance Blockchain. The immutable ledger, registry and exchange significantly cut costs, reduce fees, eliminate rent seeking and improve liquidity. We have identified up to $90 billion or more in value in the securitized product space that can go back to the ecosystem - and the blockchain technology that disrupts the old way of doing things. 

Legal analysis and advice on contract enforceability and other pertinent issues coupled with regulatory feedback have paved the way for broad support of Provenance Blockchain. In addition to Figure, multiple asset originators are in various stages of onboarding to generate assets on chain, with the first securitization on blockchain planned for Q3 2019. Several national banks will be participating as omnibus banks for Provenance Blockchain, providing a bridge between the blockchain and fiat currency. Multiple buy and sell side firms are able to buy and finance assets on Provenance Blockchain, and some of those firms are also stakeholders, hosting smart contracts and the resulting encrypted data they produce for the blockchain. Figure plans to operate as a qualified custodian and exchange operator \(via ATS exemption\) on Provenance in late 2019. 

While initially focused on the loan and asset-backed securitization ecosystem, Provenance has application across debt, equity, remittance and payment markets. Figure has identified over $300 billion in annual fee reductions, liquidity improvements and other benefits Provenance can deliver to global financial markets, and more use cases are being identified daily. One of the first areas beyond securitization where Provenance is being applied in pooled investment vehicles. A leading hedge fund is in the process of moving asset custody and administration entirely to Provenance Blockchain, a first for blockchain. Multiple funds – retail and institutional – are in discussion to follow this lead and use Provenance as a way to reduce costs, improve transparency and increase secondary market liquidity. 

Hash™ is the digital token native to Provenance and represents a share of the fees paid to transact on the blockchain. Provenance fees are targeted to be roughly 1/3 of the economic benefit of using the blockchain \(estimated at $36 billion or more annually\). Fees paid go to the Provenance administrator, stakeholders and Hash holders, with the majority of the economics accruing to the Hash holders. Hash is tradeable, comes with voting rights for the governance of the administrator and is non-dilutable. The market capitalization of Hash should be commensurate with the present value of the fees paid to transact on Provenance Blockchain. 

Governance of Provenance is in the form of one Hash, one vote. The Provenance Foundation is set to operate sustainably initially through its cash reserves and over time through its share of payments to transact on Provenance Blockchain.

There is 100 billion Hash and that amount is fixed. Provenance closed a $20MM \(13% of total Hash stock\) private offering of Hash in June 2019, both for capitalization and to provide sufficient Hash to support the Provenance ecosystem. Current holdings of Hash are approximately: 5% to node stakeholders, 72% Figure Technologies, Inc., 13% Hash investors, 5% strategic partners and 5% to the foundation.
