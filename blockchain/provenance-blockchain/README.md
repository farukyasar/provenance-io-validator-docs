# Provenance

> TODO: I wonder if this content, being very "blockchain for financial services" as opposed to technical in nature should be renamed `Provenance Ecosystem`? And follow Core Concepts?  Or follow/be part of Introduction?

Provenance introduces a blockchain platform designed and developed to support the needs of the financial services industry, providing **ledger**, **registry**, and **exchange** across financial assets and markets. Validators and stakeholders of Hashâ„¢ are comprised of large financial institutions, technical leaders, and individuals, providing the foundation of security and stability of the Provenance network. Provenance facilitates the establishment of an ecosystem that has garnered participation across all areas of finance including but not limited to asset originators, fund managers, servicers, banks and of course Provenance is extensible for developers to build new use cases.  

### Blockchain

Provenance employs a proof-of-stake blockchain that reduces unnecessary computational waste that has encumbered proof-of-work blockchains in broad use today. Hash is the utility token utilized to govern, secure and transact on Provenance. Assets are defined natively utilizing the [Contract Execution Environment](../../p8e/overview.md) in conjunction with the [Metadata Module](../../modules/metadata-module.md), enabling developers to quickly define any type of asset class, permission data to counter-parties, create mutually agreed-upon processes, define ownership structures and exchange on third party marketplaces. Provenance encapsulates three distinct levels of abstraction; modules, smart contracts, and client-side agreements each with their own set of strengths allowing complete control of consumer data.
