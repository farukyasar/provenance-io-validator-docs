# Provenance

Provenance introduces a blockchain platform designed and developed to support the needs of the financial services industry, providing registry, custody, and exchange across financial assets and markets. Validators and stakeholders of Hashâ„¢ are comprised of large financial institutions, technical leaders, and individuals that support the mission of the platform.

While initially focused on asset originators, buy-side and sell-side firms and their investors, Provenance is accessible to anyone \(entity or individual\).  Provenance embodies the attributes of blockchain \(distributed, immutable and trustless\) with the features necessary to impact financial services \(ledger, registry and exchange\). 

Provenance has four major roles:  the foundation, participants, validators and delegators. Participants are comprised of originators, investors, servicers, omnibus banks, fund managers, and of course Provenance is extensible for developers to build new use cases.
