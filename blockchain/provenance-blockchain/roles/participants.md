# Participants

### Overview

Members are entities that transact on Provenance, including Hash investors. Members can also be nodes. Members pay transaction fees to use Provenance. Members can have private conversations between themselves that are not part of the immutable record held by nodes. Members can be institutions or individuals. Members who hold Hash can participate in the daily Hash auction, and over time any member will be able to buy or sell Hash directly by showing bids and/or offers in the Provenance marketplace.  

### Omnibus Banks

Omnibus banks are the gateway to Provenance.  Any transaction that involves fiat originates through an omnibus bank.  Members may have an account directly with the omnibus bank or send/receive fiat through another bank to the omnibus bank.  Omnibus banks are responsible for the KYC/AML of members on Provenance.  The administrator may perform additional KYC/AML checks if needed.
