# Foundation

The mission of the foundation is to drive adoption of the Provenance Blockchain Platform by proposing new features, creating bounties that developers can responsible for granting permissions \(transactions\) to members and approval of stakeholders. The administrator may create but will always review smart contracts related to these permissions that each node holds to process transactions.  The administrator is also responsible for determining the cost of transactions on the protocol and for the amount of stake nodes must hold.  There is only one administrator and its board is elected by the Hash holders.
