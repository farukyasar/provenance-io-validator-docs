# Legal Standing

There are three pertinent legal points related to Provenance:

First, loan/security holders are used to having one enforceable contract relating to a unique asset. On Provenance Blockchain, there are multiple copies of the contract, held by the validators. The primary laws governing electronic contracts include the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act \(E-SIGN\), 15 U.S.C. § 7001 et seq. \(2000\), and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act \(UETA\); each of these provide a market standard for establishing control over an electronic record. Both E-SIGN and UETA utilize the same test for establishing control: “A person has control of a transferable record if a system employed for evidencing the transfer of an interest in the transferable record reliably establishes that person as the person to which the transferable record was issued or transferred.” The person in control of the single “authoritative copy” is in control of the electronic record. 

Combined, the goal of these standards is to ensure control of the single “authoritative copy” of the transferable record that is unique, identifiable, and except as permitted by the party in control, unalterable. Provenance meets these conditions to be suitable as a digital platform for custody, warehousing and securitizing assets.

In addition, the Uniform Commercial Code would categorize any electronic note, whether negotiable or non-negotiable if it were in writing, as a payment intangible as to which a secured party must perfect by filing. It is common practice for a secured party to obtain control over an electronic record if the payee of the electronic record is borrowing funds secured by a pledge of the electronic record or the electronic record is an asset being conveyed in a securitization. Similarly, for assets held on Provenance Blockchain, a filing will be made in the jurisdiction in which the applicable member is located.

Second, certain investors have limitations holding certain assets directly. For example, for tax purposes, many investors cannot own whole loans. Instead, they have a sponsor create a trust, and issue trust certificates. This introduces both the cost of setting up and administering the trust, as well as the cost of risk retention born by the sponsor. With Provenance Blockchain, a security token can replace the trust certificate, eliminating the majority of these costs. 

Finally, multiple validators are critical to the distributed ledger of Provenance Blockchain. Given that validators simply host the hashed output of client contracts, the members will indemnify the validators should such contracts fail to perform as anticipated. The onus of the client contract accuracy is on the member.  


#### **Exchange Operator and Qualified Custodian**

Provenance can support multiple custodians and exchanges but does not act as a custodian or exchange operator. Figure is in the process of securing regulatory approval for a broker dealer to secure an Alternative Trading System exemption to operate an exchange and to be a qualified custodian for certain activities on Provenance Blockchain. This approval is gating to certain activity – such as moving funds on to Provenance – but does not limit the operations around loan origination, servicing, trading and securitization.
