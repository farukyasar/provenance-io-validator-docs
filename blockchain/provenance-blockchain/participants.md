# Participants

Participants are entities that transact on Provenance, including Hash™ investors. Participants can also be validators. Participants pay transaction fees to use Provenance. Participants can have private conversations between themselves that are not part of the immutable record held by validators. Participants can be institutions or individuals. Participants who hold Hash™ can participate by delegating their stake to validators to receive rewards. Any participant can buy or sell Hash™ directly by visiting any participating Hash™ exchange.

Provenance has a group of leading financial institutions participating across functions, including:

* Participants who put assets on Provenance.  Asset originators \(loans\), funds \(investments\).
* Participants who purchase/finance assets on Provenance. Banks and funds.
* Validators/Delegators. Buy-side, sell-side firms, other financial services companies and 3rd party validators who independently host the blockchain.
* Omnibus Banks who provide a bridge between fiat and Provenance.

Participants are informed via [Explorer](../explorer.md) of which firms are validators today, and any changes in validators should they occur.   




### Omnibus Banks

Omnibus banks are the gateway to Provenance.  Any transaction that involves fiat originates through an omnibus bank.  Members may have an account directly with the omnibus bank or send/receive fiat through another bank to the omnibus bank.  Omnibus banks are responsible for the KYC/AML of members on Provenance.  The administrator may perform additional KYC/AML checks if needed.
