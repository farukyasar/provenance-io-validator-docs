# Participants

Participants are individuals/entities that transact on Provenance to register, custody and trade assets. Any participant can become a [Validators](../validator/) or [Delegators](../delegator.md). Participants pay transaction fees when executing transactions on Provenance. In addition the [Client Execution Environment](../../p8e/overview.md) can assist in facilitating private conversations and processes between participants that are hashed prior to being included in the immutable record held by validators. 

Participants who hold Hash™ can additionally participate by delegating their stake to validators to receive rewards. Any participant can buy or sell Hash™ directly by visiting any participating Hash™ exchange.

## How is Provenance being used?

Provenance has a group of leading financial institutions participating across functions, including:

* Participants who put assets on Provenance.  Asset originators \(loans\), funds \(investments\).
* Participants who purchase/finance assets on Provenance. Banks and funds.
* Validators/Delegators. Buy-side, sell-side firms, other financial services companies and 3rd party validators who independently host the blockchain.
* Omnibus Banks who provide a bridge between fiat and Provenance.
