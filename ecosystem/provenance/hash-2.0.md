# Hash

The primary purpose of Hash is as a governance and equity medium on the blockchain. Hash has a secondary function of being used for each node’s stake. Each node is required to put up a stake of Hash on which they earn a return for their services. The stake is set by the administrator and is subject to slashing in certain situations, such as downtime or double signing.

Hash holders who stake their Hash, receive fees clients pay to transact on Provenance Blockchain, and become members of and get to vote on the Provenance Foundation's Governance board. The weight of a member's vote is proportional to their stake with a maximum weight that represents 50% of the vote.

Provenance has a fixed token stock of 100 billion Hash. Hash cannot be created or destroyed. While the price of Hash will ultimately float, today each Hash holder sets a reserve price \(or declines to participate\) and fees paid to access Provenance go to the best offer\(s\) of Hash.

### Hash Economics

When members use Provenance Blockchain, they pay a fee in fiat which is designed to be commensurate with the economic benefit of using the blockchain. Fees are set by the administrator and range from 25% to 40% of the economic benefit. Each Hash investor can set a reserve offer price \(or prices\) at which they will sell Hash. As fees are paid, the administrator conducts a reverse Dutch Auction to purchase Hash from the Hash investors offering the lowest price. If there isn’t sufficient Hash at the lowest price, the next highest price is chosen, with the previous lower price now getting the higher price, and the allocation being pro-rata. For example, if a member was paying $1000 in fees and the lowest price offered by an investor was 500 Hash for $1/Hash and the next lowest price was 500 Hash for $2/Hash, the clearing price would be $2 and each investor would sell 250 Hash.

The administrator distributes the purchased Hash to the nodes, the administrator and the remaining Hash holders. Distributions are set by the Provenance administrator, with initial distributions of 5%, 15% and 80%, respectively. As node and administrator costs are generally fixed, as use of Provenance grows, the amount allocated to each will fall to the benefit of the Hash holders.

For example, in the securitization example, Provenance provides upwards of 250 bps in value. To access the blockchain, the administrator charges 33% of that benefit, or ~83 bps. That 83 bps would purchase Hash at the best clearing price, and the administrator would distribute the purchased Hash to the nodes, administrator and Hash holders.

### Hash as Digital Equity

Hash is digital equity. The following table identifies the differences in digital equity and traditional private equity.

Digital equity takes on no idiosyncratic risk of the firm, yields on the first dollar of revenue, is non-dilutive and is liquid. However, one limit on digital equity is there are no capital protections, such as liquidity preference.

‌Given the simplicity of digital equity, the market capitalization of Hash is simply the present value of the fees paid to access Provenance that is realized by Hash holders. Such fees are a percentage \(35-40%\) of the economic value captured by Provenance members from using the blockchain. For example, if Provenance was solely used for securitization and captured 100% of the securitization market, the amount paid each year to use Provenance would be $25 billion \(83 bps fee capture x $3 trillion in annual production.\). Ignoring the small amounts paid to nodes and the administrator and using a 20% discount rate and treating the fees as a perpetuity, the market capitalization of Hash \(i.e., the present value of fees\) if Provenance was used only for securitization would be $125 billion.

‌The market capitalization of Hash could rise as new use cases \(addressable market\) are identified and de-risked. Figure has identified over $90 billion in value today that Provenance can deliver to financial markets, and that number grows daily as more use cases are identified. Figure is working to identify new use cases and de-risk them through real-world adoption. Figure anticipates other members will participate in this function by utilizing Provenance in ways that demonstrate enhanced value to the ecosystem.

### ‌Initial Hash Allocation

The initial Hash allocation will be 71% to Figure \(in exchange for intellectual property\), 24% to the administrator and 5% to the initial nodes in the form of their stake. The administrator plans to allocate 5% of the total stock from its position to strategic partners \(i.e., other members including loan originators, warehouse providers, etc.\). Initial Nodes must maintain their stake, which can be less than but never more than the initial grant.

### ‌Offering Hash

Currently, the administrator plans on selling Hash in two offerings. The initial offering was a private placement. The second offering may be done as a public security offering \(IPO\).

The administrator and Figure currently intend to sell enough of their Hash allocation in the two offerings to result in a post allocation of &lt;50% Figure, 35% or more to Hash investors, 5% to the administrator, 5% to nodes and 5% to strategic partners. It is Figure’s intent to not own a majority of Hash – and thereby not have control of the administrator – post offering and Figure may participate in the IPO and/or sell Hash against member fees.
