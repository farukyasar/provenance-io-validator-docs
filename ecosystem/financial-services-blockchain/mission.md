**Blockchain has the potential to change the world of finance.** 

The $300+ trillion in global financial markets incur hundreds of billions of dollars in audit, custody, trustee, reconciliation and administrative costs each year. Many of these markets suffer from significant friction, lack of transparency and limited liquidity. Figure Technologies, Inc. \(Figure ® \) has launched a production blockchain in 2018, Provenance™, to transform financial services. 

Provenance dramatically reduces costs, improves liquidity, reduces risk and opens new financial markets. Provenance is a proof-of-stake blockchain based on three key concepts: 

* Distributed - No entity owns Provenance, and identical information is held across multiple stakeholders. 
* Immutable - Information is time stamped and cannot be changed. 
* Trustless - Truth replaces trust in information.  

Provenance acts as ledger, registry and exchange across financial assets and markets. 

The initial use case for Provenance was demonstrating how the blockchain could eliminate fees and inefficiencies in the loan origination, servicing and securitization markets. In July of 2018, Figure began generating home equity loans and subsequently selling them to financial buyers on Provenance – an industry first. Loan origination, payments, sales, financing - and in Q3 2019 loan securitization – happen entirely on Provenance. The immutable ledger, registry and exchange significantly cut costs, reduced fees, eliminated rent seeking and improved liquidity. We have identified up to $90 billion or more in value in the securitized product space that can go back to the ecosystem - and the blockchain technology that disrupts the old way of doing things. 

Legal analysis and advice on contract enforceability and other pertinent issues coupled with regulatory feedback have paved the way for broad support of Provenance. In addition to Figure, multiple asset originators are in various stages of onboarding to generate assets on chain, with the first securitization on blockchain completed in Q3 2019. Several national banks will be participating as [omnibus banks](../community/omnibus-banks.md) for Provenance, providing a bridge between the blockchain and fiat currency. Multiple buy and sell side firms are able to buy and finance assets on Provenance, and some of those firms are also stakeholders, hosting client side contracts and the resulting encrypted data they produce for the blockchain. Figure plans to operate as a qualified custodian and exchange operator \(via ATS exemption\) on Provenance in 2021. 

While initially focused on the loan and asset-backed securitization ecosystem, Provenance has application across debt, equity, remittance and payment markets. Figure has identified over $300 billion in annual fee reductions, liquidity improvements and other benefits Provenance can deliver to global financial markets, and more use cases are being identified daily. One of the first areas beyond securitization where Provenance is being applied in pooled investment vehicles**. A leading hedge fund is in the process of moving asset custody and administration entirely to Provenance,** a first for blockchain. Multiple funds – retail and institutional – are in discussion to follow this lead and use Provenance as a way to reduce costs, improve transparency and increase secondary market liquidity. 

Hash is the digital token native to Provenance and represents a share of the fees paid to transact on the blockchain. Provenance fees are incurred as gas charges when transactions are recorded to the blockchain. Fees paid are distributed as rewards to the Provenance community, stakeholders and validators, with the majority of the economics accruing to the Hash holders. Hash is tradeable, comes with voting rights for the governance of the blockchain and is non-dilutable. **The market capitalization of Hash should be commensurate with the present value of the fees paid to transact on Provenance.** 

Governance of Provenance is in the form of one Hash, one vote. The Provenance Foundation is set to operate sustainably initially through its cash reserves and over time through its share of fees paid to transact on Provenance.

There is 100 billion Hash and that amount is fixed. Provenance closed a $20MM \(13% of total Hash stock\) private offering of Hash in June 2019, both for capitalization and to provide sufficient Hash to support the Provenance ecosystem. As of 2019, holdings of Hash are approximately: 5% to node stakeholders, 72% Figure Technologies, Inc., 13% Hash investors, 5% strategic partners and 5% to the foundation.
