# Anatomy of a Provenance Application

We get into more detail than introductory and discuss transaction flow in for our 3 major use cases \(we don't have to use Figure apps, just here for easy understanding/clarification\): 

* Figure Pay \(b2c transactions, all settlement, no Assets or value exchange\)
* Figure Lending \(Asset genesis, pooling, ownership exchange\)
* Figure Marketplace \(exchange, bilateral exchange\)

Thus, this section describes the anatomy of each of these types of apps.

 **A little deeper than introductory**
