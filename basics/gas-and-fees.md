# Gas and Fees

Another import concept that casues a lot of confusion at Figure.

And, again, the Cosmos docs are great: [https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.41/basics/gas-fees.html](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.41/basics/gas-fees.html)

Keep it more high-level than Cosmos, but describe G&F and how it impacts our Applications.
