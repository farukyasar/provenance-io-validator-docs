== Introduction

Provenance is a public-but-permissioned distributed stakeholder blockchain.
It utilizes an enhanced version of Hyperledger Fabric as the underlying foundation for memorializing contract executions.
Members are entities or individuals that are permissioned to interact with Provenance.
Members are comprised of many types, including affiliates and nodes.
Affiliates are the entities that are allowed to execute contracts and submit transactions to Provenance.
Affiliates are uniquely identified by a public/private key pair registered in Provenance which is used to sign transactions.
Nodes, also referred to as stakeholders, are responsible for endorsing and committing transactions submitted by affiliates to the blockchain.
