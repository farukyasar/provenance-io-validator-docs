# p8e CEE API

In this section, you'll learn about a practical implementation of the [p8e-scope-sdk](https://github.com/provenance-io/p8e-scope-sdk), the [p8e-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/provenance-io/p8e-gradle-plugin), and the [metadata-asset-model](https://github.com/provenance-io/metadata-asset-model), which together can be used to register new p8e contract specifications ("smart contracts"), then execute those contracts to store data in the Encrypted Object Store and record assets on the Provenance Blockchain.

We will cover the [API Specification](api-specification/) and walk through the proper execution order:

1. Publishing a new p8e contract,
2. Storing data in p8e, and finally
3. Recording a new asset on the Provenance Blockchain ledger.
