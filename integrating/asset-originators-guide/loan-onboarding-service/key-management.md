# Key Management

The Provenance Blockchain network relies on public key infrastructure on both the public and client-side layers. The only thing stopping the value encapsulated in an asset that is stored on-chain from changing hands, or data from being decrypted in the Object Store is secure key management.

## Keep your keys from falling into the wrong hands

For security purposes, it is recommended that keys are stored in secure, access-controlled environments such as [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io).
