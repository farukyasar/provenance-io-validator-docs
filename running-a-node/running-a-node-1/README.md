# Running a Node

Nodes on Provenance are simply servers running the `provenanced` process with a specialized configuration. There are several types of configurations that can be used to assist in application development, seeding, data archival, validation, etc... To start, let's quickly introduce the types of configurations that may be helpful when deciding what type of node is best suited for your use case.

### Node Configurations

For an overview of the different types of nodes see [https://docs.tendermint.com/master/nodes/](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/nodes/)

// TODO define provenance node types, how they relate to tendermint node types and what they would be used for.

### Next

Now that we've introduced `provenanced` as a node service you can [join testnet ](join-provenance-testnet.md)or [create a localnet ]()for development.
