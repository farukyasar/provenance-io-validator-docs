# Configure a Validator

Validators perform the critical function of proposing and validating transactions on the Provenance network. A strong network of validators ensures Provenance security is maintained. Validators stake Hashâ„¢ to become part of the active validators on the network and are a foundational element for Hash holders that want to delegate their stake and share in rewards produced by the network's fee distribution framework.
