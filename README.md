# The Provenance Blockchain

## Getting Started

> Provenance is based on the [Cosmos SDK ](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.41/)and the [Tendermint](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/) blockchain application platforms.  It is useful to have a basic understanding of both these technologies prior to reading the Provenance documentation. Refer to the [Cosmos SDK basics documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.41/intro/overview.html#) and the [Tendermint overview](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/introduction/what-is-tendermint.html#) for more information.
