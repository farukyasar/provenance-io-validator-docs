# The Power of Blockchain

Many intermediaries argue that their services are necessary for the market to function. Who else will safeguard investors if not a trusted third party?  But such an argument is a false dichotomy as it presumes trust is necessary.

The blockchain has three key attributes: **Distributed Information, Immutable History and Trustless Data**. Information cannot be held in one location. Distributed content provides defense against hackers and eliminates agency problems that can lead to malfeasance, supporting enforceable digital contracts. Data must not be changed. Immutable information is critical in establishing asset provenance. And information must be true. Having to rep and warranty data—analogous to “trust me”—undermines the system and introduces risk to those who provide these attestations.

These attributes are necessary, but not sufficient, to eliminate rent seeking and bring incremental value to financial markets. To transform financial services, the blockchain must also perform three key functions: ledger, registry and exchange.

* **Ledger –** Movements of value are done on blockchain, delivering true economies of scale.  Immutable records reduce or eliminate the need for trustees and reconciliation and provide real time visibility to information.
* **Registry -** Ownership is determined solely on blockchain, allowing T+0 pledging and sales of assets. Chain of custody is immutable, and recording and conveyance are the same thing, eliminating latency/discrepancies.
* **Exchange -** Price discovery becomes transparent, eliminating the need for market making intermediaries. Assets can be tokenized, allowing fractionalized sales and creating liquidity in illiquid asset classes.
