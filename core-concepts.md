# Track Kickoff

Thought: the documentation will tell a different story depending on which `track` the reader wishes to follow.  The tracks would depend on _how_ the Provenance ecosystem will be used:

* Asset Origination: an external organization \(i.e. Figure Lending\) that wishes to onboard their assets and sell them on a marketplace.  This track leverages CEE, Markers, and Exchange.
  * Creates value and exchanges value
  * Business application developer-centric
* Asset Investments: an external organization that purchases assets on a marketplace.  This track leverages Markers, Exchange, and bi-lateral SC
  * Exchanges value
  * Business application developer-centric
* Asset Sharing \(Custody?\): an external organization that onboards assets and shares asset information with other organizations.
  * Creates value \(intrinsic\)
  * Business application developer-centric
* Deposit and Transfer: an organization \(i.e. Figure Pay\) uses Provenance and a fiat bridge to mint and transfer coin.  Markers.
  * Ledgering
  * Business application developer-centric
* Token Trader/Investor/Speculator?
* Validator: an organization stakes Hash as a validating node
  * Operational
* Delegator: an organization/entity stakes Hash to a Validator
  * Operational
* Blockchain Developer: an organization/entity contributes to the OSS product?



Now we start getting into great detail, the best detail.

It may be that we use the major sections from the existing [Provenance](blockchain/provenance-blockchain/) page?

Hmm, really need to think about how we're framing this documentation - what is it:

1. Reference so 3rd parties can develop Applications?  In that case Core Concepts becomes CEE, PB, and simple client
2. Is it a reference storing value?  If so, that's PB with a Cosmos lean
3. Is it a smart contracting platform?
4. Is it a reference for running a Node?  That's Cosmos/TM set up
5. Is it a reference for trading Hash?

Therein lies the issue: what is the goal of this documentation?  Is it all encompassing from developing product on Provenance, to participating in the Provenance ecosystem, to using it only as value exchange, to using it for something completely out of our 3 use cases?
