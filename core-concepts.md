# Core Concepts

Now we start getting into great detail, the best detail.

It may be that we use the major sections from the existing [Provenance](blockchain/provenance-blockchain/) page?

Hmm, really need to think about how we're framing this documentation - what is it:

1. Reference so 3rd parties can develop Applications?  In that case Core Concepts becomes CEE, PB, and simple client
2. Is it a reference storing value?  If so, that's PB with a Cosmos lean
3. Is it a smart contracting platform?
4. Is it a reference for running a Node?  That's Cosmos/TM set up
5. Is it a reference for trading Hash?

Therein lies the issue: what is the goal of this documentation?  Is it all encompassing from developing product on Provenance, to participating in the Provenance ecosystem, to using it only as value exchange, to using it for something completely out of our 3 use cases?
